DESCRIPTION:
-----------

As a developer, I need a DMN when below conditions are met:

Condition

Payor -Medicaid-Tx (PBR =45, ERA)

Action = 'BATCHEXCEPTION'

Eradiscardstatusreasonid = 'UNKNOWN'

Action

sets a discard status reason to 'OFFSET'.

then discard the batch exception as offset and close the unpostable as 'Created: Offset'

If an unpostable ID is found, it updates the unpostable record with the current date, event ID, and status, marking it as 'CLOSED

adds a note to the unpostable record -  'Please contact Medicaid-TX as the money for this batch%'
